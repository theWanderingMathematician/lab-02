Plastic pollution is a major and growing problem, negatively affecting oceans and wildlife health.
[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution) has a lot of great data at various levels including globally, per country, and over time.
For this lab we focus on data from 2010.

Additionally, National Geographic ran a data visualization communication contest on plastic waste as seen [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/funding-opportunities/innovation-challenges/plastic/dataviz/).

# Learning goals

-   Visualising numerical and categorical data and interpreting visualisations
-   Recreating visualizations
-   Getting more practice using with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub

# Getting started

[Go to lab](https://github.com/dsci-151-spr24/lab02)

Then make your own copy of this by clicking on `Use this template`:

```{r git-template, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repo-template.png")
```

Grab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio.
Refer to Lab 01 if you would like to see step-by-step instructions for cloning a repo into an RStudio project.

First, open the R Markdown document `lab-02.Rmd` and Knit it.
Make sure it compiles without errors.
The output will be in the file markdown `.md` file with the same name.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for this analysis.
Run the following code in the Console to load this package.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

The dataset for this assignment can be found as a csv file in the `data` folder of your repository.
You can read it in using the following.

```{r load-data, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

The variable descriptions are as follows:

-   `code`: 3 Letter country code
-   `entity`: Country name
-   `continent`: Continent name
-   `year`: Year
-   `gdp_per_cap`: GDP per capita constant 2011 international \$, rate
-   `plastic_waste_per_cap`: Amount of plastic waste per capita in kg/day
-   `mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap`: Amount of mismanaged plastic waste per capita in kg/day
-   `mismanaged_plastic_waste`: Tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste
-   `coastal_pop`: Number of individuals living on/near coast
-   `total_pop`: Total population according to Gapminder

# Warm up

-   Recall that RStudio is divided into four panes. Without looking, can you name them all and briefly describe their purpose?
    -   *The console, where code runs that loads in packages and which code from affects the entire project, as well as knitting files and running code chunks,*

    -   *The viewer frame, where you can view packages, documentation screens, files, and the directory of files,*

    -   *The environment, which monitors history and data, and manages git commands,*

    -   *And the source code, where you can edit the files and programs themselves.*
-   Verify that the dataset has loaded into the Environment. How many observations are in the dataset? Clicking on the dataset in the Environment will allow you to inspect it more carefully. Alternatively, you can type `View(plastic_waste)` into the Console to do this.
    -   *There are 240 observations in the `plastic_waste` dataset.*

```{marginfigure}
**Hint:** If you're not sure, run the command `?NA` which will lead you to the documentation.
```

-   Have a quick look at the data and notice that there are cells taking the value `NA` -- what does this mean?
    -   *Those cells have no values or types in them, and therefore render as `NA` instead of as an empty cell.*

# Exercises

Let's start by taking a look at the distribution of plastic waste per capita in 2010.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-hist, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

One country stands out as an unusual observation at the top of the distribution.
One way of identifying this country is to filter the data for countries where plastic waste per capita is greater than 3.5 kg/person.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-max, eval=TRUE}
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```

Did you expect this result?
You might consider doing some research on Trinidad and Tobago to see why plastic waste per capita is so high there, or whether this is a data error.

1.  Plot, using histograms, the distribution of plastic waste per capita faceted by continent. What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita?

```{marginfigure}
**NOTE:** From this point onwards the plots and the output of the code are not displayed in the lab instructions, but you can and should the code and view the results yourself.
```

```{r}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, ncol=2) 
```

Another way of visualizing numerical data is using density plots.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_density()
```

And compare distributions across continents by colouring density curves by continent.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

The resulting plot may be a little difficult to read, so let's also fill the curves in with colours as well.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color-fill}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

The overlapping colours make it difficult to tell what's happening with the distributions in continents plotted first, and hence covered by continents plotted over them.
We can change the transparency level of the fill color to help with this.
The `alpha` argument takes values between 0 and 1: 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque.
There is no way to tell what value will work best, so you just need to try a few.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color-fill-alpha}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```

This still doesn't look great...

1.  Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha level that works better for displaying the density curves for all continents.

    -   *I have also limited the x-values of the data to those between 0 and 1 so that we can see the data more clearly, since we already know that Trinidad and Tobago is much higher than the rest, and the empty space between it and the rest is a waste of space on the graph, while this makes the bulk of the data more clearly visible, with only the one data point missing.*

    ```{r}
    ggplot(plastic_waste, 
           aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                         color = continent, 
                         fill = continent)) +
      geom_density(alpha = 0.2) +
      xlim(0, 1) +
      labs(x = "Plastic waste per capita",
           colour = "Continent")
    ```

2.  Describe why we defined the `color` and `fill` of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot but we defined the `alpha` level as a characteristic of the plotting geom.

    -   *The `color` and `fill` are defined in the mapping aesthetics because they vary for the different continents' curves, while the alpha value is the same, hard-coded value for all of the curves, and therefore is defined in the geom\_\*\*() function itself.*

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è *Now is a good time to knit your document and commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

And yet another way to visualize this relationship is using side-by-side box plots.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-box}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  labs(y = "Plastic waste per capita",
       x = "Continent") +
  coord_flip()
```

-   *Once again, in order to make the data visible, I've limited the y values to those between 0 and 1, since otherwise the data would be hard to read on the bottom of the chart.*

1.  Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to [violin plots](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html). What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-violin}
ggplot(plastic_waste, 
       aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_violin() +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  labs(y = "Plastic waste per capita",
       x = "Continent") +
  coord_flip()
```

-   *In the violin plot, we can see the distribution of the values within the data range better than the general distribution we see in the pox plot. However, in the box plots, we can see the median clearly, along with the other quartiles, three numbers which can only be approximated using the violin plots. In addition to this, it can be hard to tell the number and positions of outliers from the violin plot, while this can be seen easily in the box plot.*

```{marginfigure}
**Remember:** We use `geom_point()` to make scatterplots.
```

1.  Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita using a scatterplot.
    Describe the relationship.

``` {r}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                          y = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Plastic waste per capita",
       y = "Mismanaged plastic waste per capita")# +
  #xlim(0, 1)
```

- *Both with and without the commented `xlim()` function, we can see that there is a positive correlation between the two variables. From the zoomed-in area, it seems to follow the rule `y <= 0.8x`. However, there are many countries clumped together at the bottom of the chart, so this correlation may just be due to the fact that mismanaged plastic waste per capita must be both higher than zero and less than the total plastic waste per capita.*

2.  Colour the points in the scatterplot by continent.
    Does there seem to be any clear distinctions between continents with respect to how plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita are associated?

``` {r}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                          y = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap,
                          colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  labs(x = "Plastic waste per capita",
       y = "Mismanaged plastic waste per capita", 
       colour = "Continent")

```

- *for this plot, I have uncommented the limit function, so that we can see the rest of the data more clearly. Some visual coordinations do seem to stick out: African countries are generally on the higher side of this graph, with most of their pollution being mismanaged. European countries are generally on the lower side of this graph, except for when plastic waste per capita is below 0.25, when they're roughly evenly distributed. North America is generally somewhere in the middle, and South American countries are in the lower side of the graph, except for one which is significantly higher up and further to the right than the others. Asian countries, meanwhile, have no discernable trend, being spread across the entire chart.* 

3.  Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and total population as well as plastic waste per capita and coastal population.
    You will need to make two separate plots.
    Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated?
    
```{r}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                          y = total_pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ylim(0, 2e+08) +
  labs(x = "Plastic waste per capita",
       y = "Total population")

ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                          y = coastal_pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ylim(0, 2e+07) +
  labs(x = "Plastic waste per capita",
       y = "Coastal population")
```

- *Neither of these appear to be strongly linear correlations; however, if I had to say which one was closer to a linear correlation, it would be the second chart, since the first one seems more exponential than linear; at the same time, the second one seems to be more random. Ultimately, I don't think a visual analysis is working very well for this question, since neither have an especially linear trend, no matter how I limit the y values. At least, they don't seem more associated to the amount of plastic waste than the other is.*

# Wrapping up

We don't expect you to complete all of the exercises within the hour reserved for the live workshop.
Ideally, you should have got to this point.
If you still have some time left, move on to the remaining exercises below.
If not, you should find a time to meet with your team and complete them after the workshop.
If you haven't had time to finish the exercises above, please ask for help before you leave!

```{marginfigure}
**Hint:** The x-axis is a calculated variable. One country with plastic waste per capita over 3 kg/day has been filtered out. And the data are not only represented with points on the plot but also a smooth curve. The term "smooth" should help you [pick which geom to use](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-geoms).
```

1.  Recreate the following plot, and interpret what you see in context of the data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
plastic_waste %>% 
  mutate(coastal_pop_prop = coastal_pop / total_pop) %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = coastal_pop_prop, y = plastic_waste_per_cap, color = continent)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(color = "black") +
    scale_color_viridis_d() +
    labs(x = "Coastal population proportion (Coastal / total population)", 
         y = "Plastic waste per capita ", 
         color = "Continent",
         title = "Plastic waste vs. coastal population proportion",
         subtitle = "by continent") +
    theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 1) %>%
  mutate(coastal_pop_proportion = coastal_pop/total_pop) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = coastal_pop_proportion,
             y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = continent)) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d() +
  geom_smooth(colour="black") +
  labs(title = "Plastic waste vs. coastal population proportion", 
       subtitle = "by continent",
       x = "Coastal population proportion (Coastal/total population)",
       y = "Plastic waste per capita",
       colour = "Continent") +
  theme_minimal()

```

- *The proportion of the population on the coast of a country seems to have only a slight correlation to the plastic waste per capita, as exemplified by the near-horizontality of the smoothed line. In addition to this, most countries actually seem to be under the average, with the smaller number of large producers of plastic waste bringing the average up.*

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards and review the md document on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work.*

Once you're done, submit a PDF copy of the lab to moodle.
